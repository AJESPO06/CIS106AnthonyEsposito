# CIS106 Anthony Esposito

## Assignment 1

  Hello Professor and classmates (if you are reading this). The reason I am taking this course is to get my feet wet in coding. I have played around with Python, although I would like to take an actaul course since consistency is the key to mastering anything. I would like to master some beginnner friendly, englished based languages before moving on to more complex languages. Ever since a kid I knew I would end up in a tech career, so what better way to end up there than to get a CIS degree? I know this class is setting me up for future success in learning other languages and reaching my goal of landing a job programming. I am excited to see what the future brings with taking this course!

## Assignment 2

Hello Professor,

  The programming language I am choosing to use for this course is Python. I would like to learn python since it is easiest to begin with and this course is based off of Python. I plan to use Python to make an NES emulator on the a Raspberry Pi for a Christmas gift to my father, since he loves NES. I plan to continue using GDBonline since I have an account and a few previous projects saved. I am used to using GDBonline so I will continue using that unless I have to change IDE's.

## Assignment 3

Hello Professor,

  During this assignment the most important thing I learned was understanding shapes and key terms in flowgarithm. I was intimidated originally by all of the different shapes and "unfamiliar words." I am glad I read Chapter 2 in the textbook twice and watched Youtube on the topics I did not understand. This assignment challenged me during the Flowgarithm chart due to the different errors I repeatedly got when trying to get it to calculate the totaly pay. This assignment showed me the importance in delcaring, assigning, inputs, outputs etc. Finally understanding the assignment, I was very happy to run the program and having the program do what it was intended to do. I chose this assignment in particular because I have previously used pay calculators and to understand how to make one is satisfying. Since I could translate my Flowchart to Python I am also starting to get a grasp of that language as well. I cannot wait to see the possibilities once I am fully fluent Python and master Flowcharts.
