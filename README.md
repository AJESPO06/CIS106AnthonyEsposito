# Assignment 1

Hello Professor and classmates (if you are reading this). The reason I am taking this course is to get my feet wet in coding. I have played around with Python, although I would like to take an actaul course since consistency is the key to mastering anything. I would like to master some beginnner friendly, englished based languages before moving on to more complex languages. Ever since a kid I knew I would end up in a tech career, so what better way to end up there than to get a CIS degree? I know this class is setting me up for future success in learning other languages and reaching my goal of landing a job programming. I am excited to see what the future brings with taking this course!
